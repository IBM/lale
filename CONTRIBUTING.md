# Contributing to Lale

Lale is an open-source project, and we appreciate your help!

To make contributions to this Github repository, please submit a pull
request (PR). In addition, we expect contributors to submit a
"Developer's Certificate of Origin" by signing the following form:
[DCO1.1.txt](https://github.com/IBM/lale/blob/master/DCO1.1.txt).

One suggested contribution is adding more
[operators](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/IBM/lale/blob/master/examples/docs_new_operators.ipynb).
Furthermore, we recently gave a
[webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szXkof_IiGc) as part of the
"Open Source Directions" series by Quansight. Among other things, the
webinar discusses possible contributions and future directions. So if
you are interested in contributing and are looking for inspiration, go
check it out!

The development workflow for Lale resembles that of other open-source
projects on Github. The following visualization shows how to submit a
PR:
