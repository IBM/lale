Lale is a Python library for data science with an emphasis on automation, usability, and interoperability.
Lale can be installed just like any other Python package and can be
edited with off-the-shelf Python tools such as Jupyter notebooks.
Lale is compatible with Scikit-learn while adding value for
automation, correctness checks, and interoperability.
Lale performs type-checking to catch mistakes when there is a mismatch
between hyperparameters and their type, or between data and operators.
Lale provides a consistent high-level interface to a growing set of AI
automation tools including GridSearchCV, SMAC, and Hyperopt.
Lale has a growing library of transformers and estimators from popular
libraries such as Scikit-learn, XGBoost, PyTorch etc.

   installation


The name Lale, pronounced *laleh*, comes from the Persian word for
tulip. Similarly to popular machine-learning libraries such as
Scikit-learn, Lale is also just a Python library, not a new stand-alone
programming language. It does not require users to install new tools
nor learn new syntax.

The following paper has a technical deep-dive::
