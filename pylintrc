# R0801: duplicate code warning
# R1705: no-else-return
#   I don't agree with this one
# C0301: Line too long.
#   Triggers on long descriptions in schemas.
#   We use flake8 to enforce a more tolerant version
# C0414: Import alias does not rename original package
#   We use these aliases deliberately in __init__ files, in order
#   to mark them as re-exported, so that pyright treats them as
#   public and not private

# C0103: doesn't conform to snake_case naming style
#   This probably should be enabled, with exceptions for
#   names like 'X' and 'y' using good-names (below)

# E0401: Unable to import XXX
#   We should fix the environment such that imports are resolved succesfully

# C0114: Missing module docstring
#   We should add them and enable this

# C0115: Missing class docstring
#   We should probably add them and enable this, but probably lower priority than C0114

# C0116: Missing function or method docstring
#   We should probably add them and enable this, but probably lower priority than C0114,C0115

# We do not want to enforce our style guidelines on the autogenerated code/schemas
# For now, we will ignore tests (to prioritize compliance for the library)
