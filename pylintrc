# import-error (E0401)
#   TODO: We should fix the environment such that imports are resolved successfully

# exec-used (W0122)
#   We already check for this with bandit, so no need to double up on comments marking exceptions
# unused-import (W0611)
#   We already check for this with flake8, so no need to double up on comments marking exceptions


# unnecessary-pass (W0107): Unnecessary pass statement
#   Technically, a docstring suffices, but this is a style issue that is not so clear
# logging-not-lazy (W1201)
# logging-format-interpolation (W1202)
# logging-fstring-interpolation (W1203)
#   The performance difference is negligible and format strings are more readable


# fixme (W0511)
#   It can be useful to leave these notes in the code

# unused-variable (W0612), unused-argument (W0613)

# useless-parent-delegation (W0246): Useless parent or super() delegation in method
#   These are not always useless, since we check if methods such as predict are
#   explicitly defined in a class

# broad-except (W0703): Catching too general exception
#   Unclear, but we may want to mark the ones that we need and turn this on

# attribute-defined-outside-init (W0201)
#   TODO: We should fix these and enable this

# protected-access (W0212): Access to a protected member
#   TODO: We should fix these and enable this

# abstract-method (W0223):
#   This gives a number of false positives, but it might be worth addressing

# line-too-long (C0301)
#   Triggers on long descriptions in schemas.
#   We use flake8 to enforce a more tolerant version
# useless-import-alias (C0414): Import alias does not rename original package
#   We use these aliases deliberately in __init__ files, in order
#   to mark them as re-exported, so that pyright treats them as
#   public and not private

# invalid-name (C0103): doesn't conform to snake_case naming style
#   TODO: This probably should be enabled, with exceptions for
#   names like 'X' and 'y' using good-names (below)

# missing-module-docstring (C0114)
#   TODO: We should add them and enable this

# missing-class-docstring (C0115)
#   TODO: We should probably add them and enable this, but probably lower priority than C0114

# missing-function-docstring (C0116)
#   TODO: We should probably add them and enable this, but probably lower priority than C0114,C0115

# duplicate-code (R0801): duplicate code warning
# no-else-return (R1705):
#   I don't agree with this one

# dangerous-default-value (W0102)
#   fixme: This one should fixed and enabled
