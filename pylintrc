# E0401: Unable to import XXX
#   TODO: We should fix the environment such that imports are resolved successfully

# W0107: Unnecessary pass statement
#   Technically, a docstring suffices, but this is a style issue that is not so clear

# W1201, W1202, W1203: lazy logging interpolation
#   The performance difference is negligible and format strings are more readable

# W0122: exec-used
#   We already check for this with bandit, so no need to double up on comments marking exceptions

# W0611: Unused import
#   We already check for this with flake8, so no need to double up on comments marking exceptions

# W0511: fixme

# W0612,W0613: unused variable, unused argument

# W0246: Useless parent or super() delegation in method
#   These are not always useless, since we check if methods such as predict are
#   explicitly defined in a class

# W0201: Attribute defined outside of __init__
#   TODO: We should fix these and enable this

# W0212: Access to a protected member
#   TODO: We should fix these and enable this

# R0801: duplicate code warning
# R1705: no-else-return
#   I don't agree with this one

# C0301: Line too long.
#   Triggers on long descriptions in schemas.
#   We use flake8 to enforce a more tolerant version
# C0414: Import alias does not rename original package
#   We use these aliases deliberately in __init__ files, in order
#   to mark them as re-exported, so that pyright treats them as
#   public and not private

# C0103: doesn't conform to snake_case naming style
#   TODO: This probably should be enabled, with exceptions for
#   names like 'X' and 'y' using good-names (below)

# C0114: Missing module docstring
#   TODO: We should add them and enable this

# C0115: Missing class docstring
#   TODO: We should probably add them and enable this, but probably lower priority than C0114

# C0116: Missing function or method docstring
#   TODO: We should probably add them and enable this, but probably lower priority than C0114,C0115

# W0703: Catching too general exception
#   Unclear, but we may want to mark the ones that we need and turn this on
