# import-error (E0401)
#   For this to work, we either need to add our dependencies to the pre-commit
#   task that runs this, or change to using a system (instead of python) local repo.
#   This adds some complexity (e.g. user must install pylint and the required dependencies
#   in their current python environment first).
#   For now, we just disable this error.
#   TODO: At some point, we may enable it, allowing pylintrc to perform more precise analysis

# exec-used (W0122)
#   We already check for this with bandit, so no need to double up on comments marking exceptions
# unused-import (W0611)
#   We already check for this with flake8, so no need to double up on comments marking exceptions


# unnecessary-pass (W0107)
# unnecessary-ellipsis (W2301)
#   Technically, a docstring suffices, but this is a style issue that is not so clear

# logging-not-lazy (W1201)
# logging-format-interpolation (W1202)
# logging-fstring-interpolation (W1203)
#   The performance difference is negligible and format strings are more readable

# _fixme (W0511)
#   It can be useful to leave these notes in the code

# unused-argument (W0613)
#   The arguments to a function (and their name) are part of the API
#   of a function.  Whether it uses the argument is an implementation detail
#   that should not affect the argument names, and adding lots of annotations
#   is undesirable

# useless-parent-delegation (W0246): Useless parent or super() delegation in method
#   These are not always useless, since we check if methods such as predict are
#   explicitly defined in a class

# broad-except (W0703): Catching too general exception
#   Unclear, but we may want to mark the ones that we need and turn this on

# attribute-defined-outside-init (W0201)
#   TODO: We should fix these and enable this

# protected-access (W0212): Access to a protected member
#   TODO: We should fix these and enable this

# abstract-method (W0223):
#   This gives a number of false positives, but it might be worth addressing

# line-too-long (C0301)
#   Triggers on long descriptions in schemas.
#   We use flake8 to enforce a more tolerant version

# useless-import-alias (C0414): Import alias does not rename original package
#   We use these aliases deliberately in __init__ files, in order
#   to mark them as re-exported, so that pyright treats them as
#   public and not private

# import-outside-toplevel (C0415)
#  We do this a lot, and often with reason (e.g. circular dependencies)

# invalid-name (C0103): doesn't conform to snake_case naming style
#   TODO: This probably should be enabled, with relaxations/exceptions for
#   names like 'X' and 'y' and similar derived names

# missing-module-docstring (C0114)
# missing-class-docstring (C0115)
# missing-function-docstring (C0116)
#   We may want to enable some of these,
#   but note that our wrapper impls generally don't (currently)
#   bother with them

# too-many-lines (C0302)
#   yes, some of our files are a bit long

# cyclic-import (R0401)
#   We have a bunch of these

# duplicate-code (R0801): duplicate code warning
# no-else-return (R1705):
#   Not sure if we want to enforce this

# too-many-ancestors (R0901)
# too-many-instance-attributes (R0902)
# too-few-public-methods (R0903)
# too-many-public-methods (R0904)
# too-many-return-statements (R0911)
# too-many-branches (R0912)
# too-many-arguments (R0913)
# too-many-locals (R0914)
# too-many-statements (R0915)
# too-many-boolean-expressions (R0916)
# too-many-nested-blocks (R1702)
#   some of our code is complex
