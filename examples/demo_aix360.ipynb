Each row describes a person using several features that may help evaluate them as a potential loan applicant. The task is to classify people into either good or bad credit risks. We load the version of the dataset from OpenML along with some fairness metadata."

The fairness information induces groups in the dataset by outcomes and by privileged groups. We want the distribution of these groups to be similar for the training set and the holdout set. Therefore, we split the data in a stratified way."
