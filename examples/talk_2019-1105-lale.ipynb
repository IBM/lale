    "novel concepts around which we designed Lale. Lale distinguishes two\n",
    "kinds of operators: *individual operators* are data-science primitives\n",
    "such as data preprocessors or predictive models, whereas *pipelines*\n",
    "are compositions of operators. Each operator, whether individual or\n",
    "composite, can be in one of four lifecycle states: meta-model,\n",
    "planned, trainable, and trained. The lifecycle state of an operator is\n",
    "defined by which bindings it has. Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Meta-model*: Individual operators at the meta-model state have\n",
    "  schemas and priors for their hyperparameters. Pipelines at the\n",
    "  meta-model state have steps (which are other operators) and a\n",
    "  grammar.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Planned*: To get a planned pipeline, we need to *arrange* it by\n",
    "  binding a specific graph topology. This topology is consistent with\n",
    "  but more concrete than the steps and grammar from the meta-model\n",
    "  state.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Trainable*: To get a trainable individual operator, we need to\n",
    "  initialize the concrete bindings for its hyperparameters.\n",
    "  Scikit-learn does this using `__init__`; Lale emulates that syntax\n",
    "  using `__call__`. To get a trainable pipeline, we need to bind\n",
    "  concrete operator choices given by the `|` combinator.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Trained*: To get a trained individual operator, we need to *fit* it\n",
    "  to the data, thus binding its learnable coefficients. A trained\n",
    "  pipeline is like a trainable pipeline where all steps are trained.\n",
    "  More generally, the lifecycle state of a pipeline is limited by the\n",
    "  least upper bound of the states of its steps.\n",
