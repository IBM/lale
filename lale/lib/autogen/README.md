# Autogenerated schemas for scikit-learn operators

The JSON Schemas contained in this directory were automatically generated from the source code of 115 scikit-learn operators.
To build the schemas we mined the docstring and refined the resulting schema via dynamic analysis of the implementation.
The resulting schemas are all valid and usable to build Lale pipelines.

The following paper describes the schema extractor:
