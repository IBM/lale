  - build
# We are less worried about tests, as they are not a part of the library meant to be used by users
# with untrusted inputs.
  - test
skips:
  - B101 # allow the use of assert

# We would like to allow the use of some things like B311: random.choice/randrange/... in tests.
# The ability to specify this is requested as
# https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit/issues/943
# for now, just disable the check, but if this issue becomes solved,
# then we should re-enable it for the other code
# For now, we are just excluding the test directory from scanning
